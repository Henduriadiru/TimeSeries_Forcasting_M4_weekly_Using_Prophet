# TimeSeries_Forcasting_M4_weekly_Using_Prophet
ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting on M4 Weekly Dataset using Facebook Prophet  This project showcases time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet on weekly data from the M4 competition. The goal is to predict future values for selected variables (V2, V3, and V4), with clear visualizations and confidence intervals to support interpretation.

ðŸ“Š Forecasting Weekly Time Series Data (M4 Dataset) using Facebook Prophet

This project applies Facebook Prophet to perform univariate time series forecasting on selected variables (V2, V3, V4) from the M4 Weekly dataset. The dataset is split into training and test sets. Prophet is used to:

Fit time series models on the test dataset columns

Forecast the next 12 weekly periods for each series

Visualize predictions along with upper and lower uncertainty intervals (yhat, yhat_lower, yhat_upper)

Compare forecasts across multiple variables in a unified plot

Annotate each forecasted value to enhance interpretability

The main goal is to demonstrate how Prophet can be used effectively for short-term forecasting and produce interpretable visual outputs that capture trends and seasonality.

This project is suitable for:

Practicing multivariate forecast visualization

Learning Prophet's workflow on multiple time series

Demonstrating uncertainty bounds in forecasts
